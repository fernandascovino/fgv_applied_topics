# Balancing and clustering on signed network about abortion on Brazilian parliament
---

This analysis is a continuation of the network created for the Discreet Mathematics course on the interaction of deputies in the abortion theme in the Chamber. The project developed previously on the consisted creation and analysis of the centrality of the network of interests of deputies, in which each edge represented a process that two deputies (vertex) acted together.

We extend this study here by incorporating the nature of the propositions in question (For / Against abortion) in the form of a edge signed graph, and we will study the balancing and clustering existing in this network.
